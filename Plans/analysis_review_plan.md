# Analysis Review Plan

1. Read and summarize `GEMINI.md`, `state_analysis_plan.md`, `county_level_analysis_plan.md`, and `Analysis/econometric_review.md`; note explicit goals, datasets, and stated methods.
2. Map each analysis plan step to identification strategy, data structure, and econometric assumptions; flag scope gaps or inconsistencies with `GEMINI.md`.
3. Assess data appropriateness and measurement: variable definitions, timing, level of aggregation, exposure construction, and potential confounding; list robustness checks needed.
4. Evaluate regression specifications for identification threats (endogeneity, SUTVA, spillovers, policy endogeneity), inference (cluster structure, serial correlation), and robustness; propose fixes.
5. Compile a detailed, PhD-level critique organized by scope, data, econometrics, and practical execution risks, with prioritized recommendations.
